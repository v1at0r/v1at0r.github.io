Hey there! I am Mudit, a Master's student at the [Department of Mathematics, UBC](https://www.math.ubc.ca), fortunate to be advised by [Dr. Andrew Rechnitzer](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~andrewr/front_page.html). I completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from [IIIT Delhi](https://www.math.ubc.ca).

When I am not studying math, watching anime, or failing academically, I like to trek and play tennis. I also like running, playing chess, and trying to boulder. I spend way too much time on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7e4oUmqbUx0NV43JjmlxRZ) as well.

At IIIT Delhi, I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Samrith Ram](https://sites.google.com/site/samrithram/home), [Dr. Manuj Mukherjee](https://sites.google.com/view/manuj-mukherjee/home), and [Dr. Anuradha Sharma](https://www.anuradhasharma.info/).

At the University of Victoria, I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Aaron Gulliver](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~agullive/) and [Dr. Sajin Koroth](https://web.uvic.ca/~skoroth/).

Currently, I am dabbling in Analytic Combinatorics, Representation Theory, Information Theory, and Coding Theory. I am also exploring other fields like Functional Analysis.

I am a firm believer in $$\tau$$ supremacy in the $$\pi$$ vs $$\tau$$ debate.

My detailed CV can be found [here]({{ page.cv_pdf | prepend: 'assets/pdf/Mudit_Long_CV.pdf' | relative_url}}) and a smaller but more academic-focussed one can found [here]({{ page.cv_pdf | prepend: 'assets/pdf/Mudit_CV.pdf' | relative_url}}) :)
