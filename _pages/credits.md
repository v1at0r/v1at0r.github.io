I firmly believe in giving credit where credit is due, and this (hilariously underprepared) webpage is no exception. A huge shoutout to [Mayank Rawat](https://mayank18049.github.io) for finding this theme and helping me set it up. Another shoutout to [Maruan Al-Shedivat](https://maruan.alshedivat.com/) for developing this amazing theme and open-sourcing it on [github](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio).

Thanks a lot :)
