Hey there! I am Mudit, currently a CS Major. I will be completing my undergraduate studies in May 2023. I am interested in pursuing Mathematics further.

When I am not studying math, watching anime, or failing academically, I like to trek and play tennis. I also like running and playing chess. I spend way too much time on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathmemes/) and [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7e4oUmqbUx0NV43JjmlxRZ) as well.

At IIIT Delhi, I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Samrith Ram](https://sites.google.com/site/samrithram/home), [Dr. Anuradha Sharma](https://www.anuradhasharma.info/), [Dr. Satish Kumar Pandey](http://noncommutative.space/), and [Dr. Shilpak Banerjee](https://sites.google.com/view/shilpakbanerjee/home) under various capacities (for a very broad definition of working). 

At the University of Victoria, I have had the pleasure of working with [Dr. Aaron Gulliver](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~agullive/) and [Dr. Sajin Koroth](https://web.uvic.ca/~skoroth/).

Currently, I am dabbling in Combinatorics, Representation Theory, Algebraic Coding Theory, and Functional Analysis. Previously, I have tried my hand at Modern Algebra, Cryptography, Algorithms, and Number Theory.

I am a firm believer in $$\tau$$ supremacy in the $$\pi$$ vs $$\tau$$ debate.

My detailed CV can be found [here]({{ page.cv_pdf | prepend: 'assets/pdf/Mudit_Long_CV.pdf' | relative_url}}), and a smaller but more academic-focussed one can found [here]({{ page.cv_pdf | prepend: 'assets/pdf/Mudit_CV.pdf' | relative_url}}) :)
